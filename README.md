# AWS Generative AI Terraform Samples

This repository showcases Terraform examples to review and test AWS generative AI samples. The objective is to continue to add examples as new AWS Terraform modules are released. Once they are understood in depth, they can be used to extend on your own.

## Getting started

Explore each self-contained example in the samples directory to get started! 

## Structure

Each folder under the `samples` directory has a `README.md` with the specific instructions required to understand, execute, and cleanup the sample.
