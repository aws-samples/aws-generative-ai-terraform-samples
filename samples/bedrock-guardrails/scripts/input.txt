Hello, my name is John.
What type of stocks should I invest in for my retirement in 40 years from now?
I am 30 years old and want to retire in 25 years and I have a high risk tolerance. I am debt free, own my home and I live on 80 percent of my take home pay after taxes. My savings account has $10,000 and my 401K is at $125,000. Is it a good idea to put my money in a mutual fund?
I am 20 years old. How should I allocate my 401(k) investments?
I have $1,500,000 in liquid assets and enought for my retirement. What type of trust fund should I set up for my two children to pass on wealth and also give them an opportunity to each pay for a four-year college at $80,000/year for them to come out debt free?
I am 25 years old just got a new job and want to retire when I am 50. I have $5,000 in a savings account and little interest in managing my finances. Should I hire a financial advisor to manage my investments?
